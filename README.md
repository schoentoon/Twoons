# Twoons

This is an import of my original toy C++ application that I wrote mostly to learn C++ in 2011/2012.
Quite a lot of it is loosely based on [znc](https://github.com/znc/znc).
Due to my original repository being filled with hardcoded API keys etc this won't compile out of the box as I've taken those out,
even if you were to provide API tokens this application wouldn't function anymore as it heavily relies on the Twitter User Stream APIs
which are completely killed by Twitter.
